## MaxBet-TV adding dynamic metadata tags server side with Create React App

To try the demo, first clone this repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/GizFullStackDevWip/MaxBet-TV.git
cd MaxBet-TV
npm install
npm run build
node server.js
```

Then visit `localhost:5000` in the browser. Try it in an incognito window if it is not working for you in your normal browser.
